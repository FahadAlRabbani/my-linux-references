## KDE

Here are some things I've learned about KDE or just key combos I want to remember.

### Keyboard Combos

`Alt + F2` - to quickly execute commands in KDE without opening a full terminal

### Restart KDE Plasmashell

Occasionally I have issues with the KDE Plasma Shell becoming unresponsive to clicks and usually just reboot to solve the issue but now I use the following commands to just restart the Plasmashell inorder to solve this issue.

Alt + F2
`killall plasmashell`

Alt + F2
`plasmashell`
